    "You will use the mission module to compute the fuel consumption over a specified mission. Therefore, you need to define the different phases your mission is composed of. That operation is done through the YAML [mission file](./data/CeRAS_missions.yml). If you have a closer look to this file, you will notice that it starts with a definition of the different flight phases (initial climb, climb, descent, holding, taxi) for which one or several flight parameter(s) is (are) varying.\n",

    "For exemple, for the initial climb phase, the first segment is performed at iso-speed with a variation of altitude up to 400ft, then a second segment defines an acceleration at iso-altitude up to 250kt and a third segment at iso-speed and targetting an altitude of 15000ft completes this phase.\n",
